        <h1>Liège Belgian Waffles with Pearl Sugar</h1>
        <img src="../images/waffle.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Liège waffles are sweeter than Brussels Belgian waffles and can be served for breakfast or dessert. Serve waffles warm or cooled with whipped cream and berries or drizzled with warm, melted chocolate.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup lukewarm milk</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups pearl sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle yeast and white sugar over warm milk in a small bowl. The milk should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 15 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, melted butter, and vanilla into the yeast mixture until evenly blended; set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir together flour and salt in a separate large bowl, and make a well in the center. Pour the egg mixture into the well, then stir in the flour mixture until a soft dough forms. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place, 80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C), until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Gently mix in the pearl sugar.</li>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Place a baseball-sized ball of dough on the preheated waffle iron. Cook waffles until golden and crisp, about 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining dough. Allow waffles to cool for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
